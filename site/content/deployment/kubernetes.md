All the Eclipse Hono&trade; components can be deployed on Kubernetes, thanks to the resources YAML files that are provided through the repository.
These files describe such components in terms of _deployments_ and _services_ in order to have the right pods running in the Kubernetes cluster so that they are able
to communicate with each other.

## Prerequisites

The main prerequisite for this kind of deployment is to have an available Kubernetes cluster, running version 1.11.x or newer. For a local development, it's pretty simple having such cluster using Minikube which is a tool that helps you run Kubernetes locally by running a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. Follow [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) for installing and having Minikube up and running.

The other prerequisite is to have the Kubectl command line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster. Follow [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for installing and configuring such a tool.

After launching Minikube and before building the Eclipse Hono images, it's necessary to execute the following command:

~~~sh
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)
~~~

In this way, the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable is set to the Docker daemon running inside the Minikube VM. Launching the following command for building the Eclipse Hono images,
such daemon will be used and the final images will be available inside the Minikube VM, ready for the deployment.

~~~sh
~/hono$ mvn clean install -Pbuild-docker-image,metrics-prometheus
~~~

## Helm based Deployment

The easiest (and recommended) way to deploy Eclipse Hono to a Kubernetes cluster is to use the *Helm* tool.
In order to use Helm, you need to have it installed properly on your system. Please refer to [Helm's installation instructions](https://docs.helm.sh/install/) for details.

### Deploying Hono using Helm's Tiller Service

You can deploy Hono using Helm with or without the *Tiller* service.
To deploy Eclipse Hono to the cluster with installed Tiller service, simply run

~~~sh
~hono/deploy$ helm install --dep-up --name eclipse-hono --namespace hono target/deploy/helm/
~~~

This will create a new `hono` namespace in the cluster and install all the components to that namespace. The name of the Helm release will be `eclipse-hono`.

You can check the status of the deployment with one of the following commands

~~~sh
$ helm list
$ helm status eclipse-hono
$ helm get eclipse-hono
~~~

### Deploying Hono without using Helm's Tiller Service

If, for whatever reason, you can't or don't want to install Helm's Tiller service in your cluster, you can still use the resources created by Helm and deploy them manually using the `kubectl` command line tool.
To generate the resources locally with Helm, run

~~~sh
~hono/deploy$ helm dep update target/deploy/helm/
~hono/deploy$ helm template --name eclipse-hono --namespace hono --output-dir . target/deploy/helm/
~~~

This should create an `eclipse-hono` folder with all the resources. Now, you can use `kubectl` to deploy them to any Kubernetes cluster

~~~sh
~hono/deploy$ kubectl apply -f ./eclipse-hono --namespace hono
~~~

### Using Hono

After successful installation, you can proceed and [access your Hono services](#accessing-hono-services)

### Undeploying Hono

To undeploy a Hono instance that has been deployed using Helm's Tiller service, run

~~~sh
~hono/deploy$ helm delete --purge eclipse-hono
~hono/deploy$ kubectl delete crd prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com delete crd prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com
~~~

The additional `kubectl delete` command is necessary to remove [Prometheus operator CRDs](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator#uninstalling-the-chart).

To undeploy a Hono instance that has been deployed manually from the resource files, run

~~~sh
~hono/deploy$ kubectl delete -f ./eclipse-hono --namespace hono
~~~

## Script based Deployment

As an alternative to the recommended Helm based deployment, Hono can also be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using a shell script which takes care of deploying Hono's components using multiple `kubectl` commands. This approach requires the [Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager) (OLM) to be available on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Deploying the Operator Lifecycle Manager

OLM is used for creating a Prometheus instance which is used as the metrics back end by Hono.
OLM can be installed by executing the `olm_deploy.sh` script. This step is only required once for a
cluster. You may skip this step if you don't want to use Prometheus based
metrics, or want to deploy Prometheus yourself.

From the directory `deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes` run:

~~~sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes$ chmod +x *.sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes$ ./olm_deploy.sh
~~~

### Deploying Hono

After having the Kubernetes cluster up and running and the `kubectl` command line tool in the PATH, the deployment can be done by running the following bash script from the `deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes` folder.

~~~sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes$ chmod +x *.sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes$ ./kubernetes_deploy.sh
~~~

In order to see the deployed components, you can launch Kubernetes' web UI in a browser by issuing:

~~~sh
$ minikube dashboard
~~~

Be sure to switch to the `hono` namespace in the UI in order to see the components deployed as part of Hono.
In the following pictures an Eclipse Hono deployment on Kubernetes is running with all the provided components.

### Undeploying Hono

There also is a script for shutting down and undeploying Hono:

~~~sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/kubernetes$ ./kubernetes_undeploy.sh
~~~

## Deploying individual Components

You may also deploy each of Hono's components separately by copying the relevant commands from the deploy script to your own script or entering them directly on the command line.

## Accessing Hono Services

The Kubernetes deployment provides access to Hono by means of *services* and the main ones are:

* **hono-dispatch-router-ext**: router network for the business application in order to consume data
* **hono-adapter-amqp-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the AMQP 1.0 protocol
* **hono-adapter-mqtt-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the MQTT protocol
* **hono-adapter-http-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the HTTP protocol
* **hono-service-device-registry**: component for registering and managing devices

You can get a list of these services running:

~~~sh
$ kubectl get services --namespace hono

The services of type `NodePort` are accessible at the Minikube VM's IP address (which you can get with the `minikube ip` command) and the corresponding *node ports* (e.g. 30080, 30671, ...).
In the following sections the `$(minikube ip)` is used  in order to put the IP address of the Minikube VM into the command to execute.

### Starting a Consumer

As described in the [Getting Started]({{< relref "getting-started.md" >}}) guide, data produced by devices is usually consumed by downstream applications which connect directly to the router network service.
You can start the client from the `cli` folder as follows:

~~~sh
~/hono/cli$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments=--hono.client.host=$(minikube ip),--hono.client.port=30671,--hono.client.username=consumer@HONO,--hono.client.password=verysecret
~~~

### Uploading Telemetry

In order to upload telemetry data to Hono, the device needs to be registered with the system. You can register the device using the
*Device Registry* by running the following command (i.e. for a device with ID `4711`):

~~~sh
$ curl -X POST -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{"device-id": "4711"}' http://$(minikube ip):31080/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT
~~~

After having the device registered, uploading telemetry is just a simple HTTP POST command to the *HTTP Adapter*:

~~~sh
$ curl -X POST -i -u sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT:hono-secret -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{"temp": 5}' http://$(minikube ip):30080/telemetry
~~~

Other than using the *HTTP Adapter*, it's possible to upload telemetry data using the *MQTT Adapter* as well:

~~~sh
$ mosquitto_pub -h $(minikube ip) -p 31883 -u 'sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT' -P hono-secret -t telemetry -m '{"temp": 5}'
~~~

The username and password used above for device `4711` are part of the example configuration that comes with Hono. See [Device Identity]({{< relref "concepts/device-identity.md" >}}) for an explanation of how devices are identified in Hono and how device identity is related to authentication.
