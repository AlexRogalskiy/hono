## Binaries

The preferred way of deploying Eclipse Hono&trade; is by means of using the pre-built Docker images provided
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipsehono/).

The most convenient way to both pull the images and start corresponding containers is by means of
Docker Compose. You can find an example Docker Compose file based on the published images here:

* [0.5-M2 Docker Compose file](docker-compose-0.5-M2.yml)

{{% note %}}
After downloading the file to your local computer you may want to rename it to just *docker-compose.yml* so that you do not need to specify the *-f* command line option with Docker Compose all the time.

## Source Code

The source code can be cloned (using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)) or downloaded from the [Eclipse Hono GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipse/hono)
